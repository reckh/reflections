What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a new repository, it creates a new empty repository in the directory.  A new repository needs to be created so that commits can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different because it offers a liminal space to add files before completing the transfer to the repository.  It offers a chance to make sure the correct files are being added to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can compared the file in the staging area to other commits to see how many differences there are.  I can also compare the file in the staging area to the file in the working directory.
